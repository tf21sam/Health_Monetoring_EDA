Health Monitoring and Analysis refers to the systematic use of health data to track and evaluate the health status of individuals or populations over time. It contains a range of activities from real-time physiological data collection (like heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) to the analysis of more complex health records (including patient history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information).
